- Kubernetes Ingress addons are additional components or features that can be installed in a Kubernetes cluster to enhance the functionality of the Ingress resource. Ingress is an API object in Kubernetes that manages external access to services within a cluster.

- Ingress addons provide advanced routing and traffic management capabilities for Kubernetes clusters. They enable features such as load balancing, SSL termination, path-based routing, and more. One popular Ingress addons is:
